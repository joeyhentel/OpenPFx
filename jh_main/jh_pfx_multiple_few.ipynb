These changes are often found incidentally, meaning they were not the reason for the scan. They can be associated with aging, high blood pressure, or other conditions. Most of the time, these lesions do not cause symptoms and do not require treatment. However, it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including managing blood pressure and cholesterol, to support brain health.
