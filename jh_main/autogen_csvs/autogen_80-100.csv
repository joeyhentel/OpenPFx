Accessory Spleen,Q89.03,"An accessory spleen is a small, extra piece of spleen tissue that is separate from the main spleen. Most people only have one spleen, but sometimes a person can have more than one. These extra pieces are usually found by accident when a person gets an imaging test like an MRI or CT scan for something else. An accessory spleen is like finding an extra piece from a puzzle that fits just right. This extra spleen usually works just like the regular spleen and doesn’t cause problems.

Splenic Mass,R16.1,"A splenic mass means there is a lump or a bump on your spleen. The spleen is an organ in your tummy that helps your body fight germs and recycle old blood cells. Sometimes, these lumps are just collections of cells that are growing in a way they shouldn't be. Think of it like a patch of clumped up small balls on a tree branch, which might not belong there.

Splenic Calcification,D73.5,"Splenic calcification means that there are tiny spots of calcium building up in the spleen, which is an organ located on the left side of the belly. This can happen for several reasons, like past infections, inflammation, or after an injury. Think of it as a small chalky area on a dark chalkboard.

Imagine the spleen like a water balloon. If you have a small cut, some water might leak out. If the spleen is injured, it might hurt, and you might feel tired.
