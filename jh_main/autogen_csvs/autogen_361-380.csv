Cervical Spinal Stenosis,M48.02,"Cervical spinal stenosis means that the space in your neck where the spinal cord sits gets smaller. Think of it as a bus lane that becomes too narrow for the bus to pass easily. With less room, the nerves in your neck can get squeezed. This can cause feelings like pain or weakness in your neck, shoulders, or arms. However, not everyone notices this change. Some might feel nothing strange, while others might have some discomfort. It's important to know what your body might be telling you with these changes.",M48.02,M48.02,True,True,92.22,1.0,1.0,7.219999999999999,1.624330900243309,0.15600000000000014
Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament,M48.8X2,"There's a stretchy band that runs along your backbone called the posterior longitudinal ligament. It helps the spine stay in line. Sometimes, parts of this band can harden up, kind of like how bread turns hard if it's left out too long. This is known as ossification. When that happens, it becomes harder for your spine to flex and move, making it feel stiff. This can sometimes hurt or make movement more difficult. It's something that needs to be kept an eye on to track any changes.",M48.8X2,M48.8,False,True,84.27,0.0,1.0,0.730000000000004,0.9156069364161847,0.9460000000000008
Cervical Kyphosis,M40.202,"Cervical kyphosis means your neck spine bends too much forward. Imagine your spine as a line of blocks that keep you straight and balanced. Normally, the neck curves a little like a soft letter 'C'. But, with kyphosis, it arches the other way, making the neck look hunched. This can cause stiffness or a bent look. Think of it like a roller coaster track with a sudden dip. Don’t worry—there are things doctors can do to help, like giving exercises and showing how to stand and move better, so you can feel confident and comfortable.",M40.202,M40.30,False,True,83.05,0.0,1.0,1.9500000000000028,0.8677966101694915,1.1900000000000006
Cervical Vertebral Fracture,S12.9XXA,"A cervical vertebral fracture is a broken bone in your neck. The neck part of the spine holds up your head and lets it move.

Cervical Rib,Q76.5,"A cervical rib is an extra rib that some people have above the first rib. Most people have 12 ribs on each side, but a cervical rib means there is one more. It is called a cervical rib because it is near the neck. Having a cervical rib usually doesn't cause any problems, and many people never know they have it. Sometimes, if it presses on nerves or blood vessels, it might cause pain or tingling, but this is not common. It’s just a special part of how some bodies are built.",Q76.5,Q76.5,True,True,81.33,1.0,1.0,3.6700000000000017,1.6428265524625267,2.3340000000000005
Atlantoaxial Instability,M43.8X2,"Atlantoaxial instability means that the top two bones in your neck, called the atlas and the axis, are not staying in place as tightly as they should. Picture it like a stack of blocks where the top block is wiggling when it shouldn't be. This happens due to reasons like an accident or a condition present since birth. Keeping your neck stable is important because it holds your head and shields important nerves. If it becomes necessary, there are ways to help make your neck steadier and to ensure it works properly, keeping safe what it should.",M43.3,M43.3,False,False,68.7,0.0,0.0,16.299999999999997,0.0115606936416185,3.26
Degenerative Disc Disease,M50.30,"Imagine your spine like a stack of blocks with soft pads between each one. These 'pads' help keep the spine flexible and absorb the bumps and shakes you experience daily. When a person has Degenerative Disc Disease, those soft pads, or discs, start to wear down, becoming thinner and less cushioned. This is a common part of aging, a bit like how a pencil eraser gets smaller and tougher the more you use it. With Degenerative Disc Disease, you might feel some pain or stiffness, especially if the discs press on nearby nerves. But remember, it's a typical change and not everyone feels pain from it.

Thyroiditis,E06.9,"Thyroiditis happens when the thyroid gland swells up. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in your neck. It can get swollen, like a balloon, for reasons such as germs or by mistake, when the body attacks it. This swelling can make the gland produce too much or too little hormone. When that happens, you might feel jumpy or very tired. The thyroid is tiny but important because it helps your body use energy.

Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma,C73,"Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma is a cancer that forms in the thyroid gland. This gland is in your neck and helps manage how your body uses energy.

Multinodular Goiter,E04.2,"A multinodular goiter means your thyroid, a small gland in your neck, has some lumps. The thyroid is like a little engine that keeps your body running.

Picture a straw that is squeezed in the middle, making it hard for the air to move through. This can happen for different reasons, like an injury, or from scar tissue, which is like a natural band-aid inside our bodies.
