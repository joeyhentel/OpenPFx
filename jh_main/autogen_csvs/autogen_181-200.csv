Rib Hemangioma,D18.09,"A rib hemangioma is a small, harmless bump made of extra blood vessels located in the bones of your ribs. Imagine it as a bunch of tiny straws put together. They are very rare and usually don’t cause any problems. Doctors often spot them by accident during tests like X-rays or MRI scans for other things. People generally don’t feel pain or discomfort from it. It’s one of those unusual things our bodies can make. If it isn’t causing trouble, it doesn’t need to be fixed.",D18.09,D18.09,True,True,75.91,1.0,1.0,9.090000000000003,1.6198216055500496,3.418000000000001
Flail Chest,S22.5XXA,Flail chest is when a part of the chest moves strangely when breathing because some ribs are broken in two or more places. Imagine it like a piece of a toy that doesn’t work right. This can make it hard to breathe and is painful. People with flail chest might feel like they can't get enough air or feel pain when they take a big breath. It is very important to be careful with the chest to avoid pain and more damage. Resting and being gentle can help in feeling better.,S22.5,S22.5,False,False,89.89,0.0,0.0,4.890000000000001,0.03395585738539898,-0.9780000000000002
Costal Cartilage Calcification,M94.8X,"Costal cartilage calcification happens when the soft parts in your ribs, which we call cartilage, start turning hard. This is because tiny pieces of calcium get inside them. Picture a soft cookie that becomes stiff when it has too many crumbs. This change is normal as we get older, like getting gray hair or wrinkles. Most people don’t even feel it because it doesn’t hurt or cause any problems. Doctors usually find it by chance when they check your ribs with X-rays or other pictures. It’s nothing to worry about.",M94.8X,M94.8,False,True,75.3,0.0,1.0,9.700000000000003,0.8186915887850468,2.7400000000000007
Tracheal Stenosis,J39.8,"Tracheal stenosis means there's a problem in the windpipe, which is the tube in your throat that carries air to your lungs. Think of your windpipe like a straw. If it’s squeezed or narrowed, it's hard for air to pass through. This narrowing can happen because of a scar or a small piece of tissue growing into the tube. You might feel it’s hard to breathe or notice a wheezing sound when you do. Usually, doctors can help by looking inside and deciding the best way to open up the windpipe and make breathing easier.",J39.8,J39.8,True,True,80.82,1.0,1.0,4.180000000000007,1.6386100386100386,2.4360000000000017
Tracheomalacia,J39.8,"Tracheomalacia is when your windpipe, or trachea, is softer than normal. Think of it like a bendy straw that can squish in. It might not bother you much, but sometimes it can make your breathing a bit noisier or give you a lingering cough. Your windpipe is the tube that helps air move in and out of your lungs, so when it's softer, it might change how breathing feels. But don't worry, many people have it without any big problems.",J39.8,J39.8,True,True,80.62,1.0,1.0,4.3799999999999955,1.6371747211895913,2.475999999999999
Tracheal Mass,D14.2 ,"A tracheal mass is like a little bump or lump inside your windpipe, which is the tube you use to breathe. This tube is a path from your nose to your lungs. Imagine using a straw to drink a milkshake: if a piece of cookie gets stuck inside, the milkshake doesn’t flow well. In a similar way, a tracheal mass might make it harder to breathe. It’s very important to have doctors check what it is, because they can help figure out the best way to deal with it so you can keep breathing easily.",D38.4,J39.8,False,False,86.03,0.0,0.0,1.0300000000000011,0.09852216748768468,-0.20600000000000024
Tracheal Deviation,J39.8,"A tracheal deviation means your windpipe, or the tube that brings air to your lungs, is not straight. It should be centered in your neck. Instead, it may tilt to one side. This can happen for several reasons like a lump in the neck, a lung issue, or extra fluid. Think of it like a tree that leans because of strong wind or something pushing it. Similarly, your windpipe has moved away from its usual place.",J39.8,J98.4,False,True,83.96,0.0,1.0,1.0400000000000063,0.8980392156862742,1.0080000000000013
Tracheal Wall Thickening,J39.8,"Tracheal wall thickening means that the wall of the windpipe, which carries air to your lungs, is thicker than it should be. Think of your trachea as a straw. Thicker walls can make it harder for air to pass through. This could happen if you have been sick, have allergies, or even if you have been coughing a lot. It's something the doctor needs to check on so you can breathe easily. Don't worry, it's just something to keep an eye on to make sure you stay healthy.",J39.8,J39.8,True,True,90.39,1.0,1.0,5.390000000000001,1.6312989045383413,0.522
Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm,I71.2,"Your doctors found a thoracic aortic aneurysm. That's a big name, but let’s make it simple. In your chest, there’s a big blood tube from your heart, called the aorta. Sometimes, part of it can get bigger, like a balloon swelling up. This is what an aneurysm is. Imagine a garden hose getting a big bump because of too much water pressure. When this happens in your chest's aorta, it’s called a thoracic aneurysm.

Pulmonary Embolism,I26.99,"A pulmonary embolism is when blood clots block the lungs' arteries. Imagine a pebble stuck in a straw, stopping water. This clump of blood forms when it does not flow well. It can make breathing hard, cause chest pain, or lead to coughing. Sometimes, it doesn’t lead to severe heart trouble like acute cor pulmonale. It's good to know these signs. Moving more and drinking water can help blood flow better and stop clots. Keeping active is like letting a river flow, which helps keep clots away.",I26.99,I26.9,False,True,85.79,0.0,1.0,0.7900000000000063,0.9117318435754187,0.6419999999999988
Superior Vena Cava Syndrome,I87.8,"Superior Vena Cava Syndrome happens when there's pressure on a big vein in your upper chest called the superior vena cava. This vein is like a highway for blood going to your heart from your head and arms. If it's blocked or squeezed, blood can't flow well. This might make your face and neck swell or turn a bit of a blue color, your voice might get hoarse, or you could find it hard to breathe.

Subclavian Artery Stenosis,I65.2,"Subclavian artery stenosis is when one of the arteries near your collarbone is too narrow. These arteries help bring blood to your arms and some parts of your head. Imagine a garden hose that has a twist in it, stopping water from flowing freely. With a narrow artery, blood doesn't flow well to where it should go. This might make your arm feel tired if you use it a lot. But, many people don’t feel any different even if they have this.

Pulmonary Artery Hypertension,I27.20,"Pulmonary Artery Hypertension means the blood vessels in your lungs have higher pressure than they should. Imagine a straw filled with water and you blow hard through it—this makes the heart work a lot harder to push the blood through. You might feel short of breath, get tired easily, or sometimes feel dizzy. Although this can sound alarming, there are ways to manage it so you can still do many things you love.

Thoracic Aortic Dissection,I71.00,"A thoracic aortic dissection is a tear in the aorta. The aorta is a large blood tube that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. Sometimes a tear can form inside, kind of like when a crack forms in a water hose. This makes a new path for the blood to flow through. This is not good because it makes the aorta weak and could lead to problems.

Systemic Venous Aneurysm,I72.8,"A systemic venous aneurysm is like having a small balloon in one of the veins that carry blood back to your heart. Normally, veins are like smooth tubes or pipes where blood flows easily. But with this aneurysm, the wall of the vein has a little bulge or pouch. Think of it like a garden hose with a swollen section. While this sounds worrying, it's not always dangerous. Sometimes, it just stays the same size and doesn't cause any problems.

Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,G54.0,"Thoracic Outlet Syndrome is when things get too tight between the collarbone and the first rib. It's like a squeezed garden hose. This space is where nerves and blood vessels pass. If it gets tight, you might feel sore or tingly in your shoulder or arm. Heavy lifting, poor posture, or an injury can cause this. When things are squeezed, it makes blood and nerve signals inside you weaker. Just like water in a kinked hose flows less. You can do exercises or change how you move to help it feel better.",G54.0,G54.0,True,True,93.64,1.0,1.0,8.64,1.620746887966805,-0.1280000000000001
