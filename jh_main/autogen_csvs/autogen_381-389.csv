Tracheal Calcifications,R93.2,"Tracheal calcifications are small, hard spots that can form on your trachea, also called your windpipe. The trachea is a tube that carries air from your nose and mouth to your lungs. These spots are usually harmless and are kind of like little bumps or wrinkles that can appear as people get older. Just as seashells become stronger over time, your trachea can show these minor changes. Most people with tracheal calcifications don't have any symptoms or problems because of them, so they're often nothing to worry about.",R93.2,J39.8,False,True,70.53,0.0,1.0,14.469999999999999,0.8129282482223659,3.694
Tracheoesophageal Fistula,Q39.0,"Imagine there's a straw connecting two places in your body. One place is your food tube (esophagus), and the other is your air tube (trachea). A tracheoesophageal fistula is like this straw. It shouldn't be there. Because of it, food or drink can go to your lungs. This might make you cough or get lung infections. Doctors need to check and fix it. When it's fixed, you can eat and breathe better. Think of it as fixing a leaky pipe so everything flows like it's supposed to.",Q39.0,Q39.0,True,True,95.47,1.0,1.0,10.469999999999999,1.61743679163034,-0.4939999999999998
Carotid Artery Stenosis,I65.2,"Carotid artery stenosis means that the blood vessels in your neck, called the carotid arteries, are getting narrow. Imagine a drinking straw: if it gets squished, less liquid can flow through. The carotid arteries are very important because they carry blood to your brain. If they become too narrow, not enough blood might reach your brain, which can be a serious problem. It's like a garden hose that needs to be clear so that water can flow. This was found by chance and it's good to be informed for future reference.",I65.2,I65.2,True,True,81.43,1.0,1.0,3.569999999999993,1.6437636761487966,2.3139999999999987
Jugular Vein Thrombosis,I82.891,"Jugular vein thrombosis means there is a blood clot in one of the veins in your neck called the jugular vein. This vein helps carry blood from your head back to your heart. Think of it like a small road jam where cars (your blood) are not moving as they should. Though not very common, it can be important to make sure the clot doesn’t cause bigger problems. Doctors usually look for reasons why this clot happened and might suggest ways to help blood move better in those veins, so things can flow smoothly again.",I82.891,I82.891,True,True,86.03,1.0,1.0,1.0300000000000011,1.6985221674876847,1.394
Vertebral Artery Dissection,I77.74,"A vertebral artery dissection is when there is a tear in one of the arteries in your neck. These arteries are important because they carry blood to your brain. Imagine a garden hose with a tiny rip in it. Some water still gets through to water the plants, but some might leak out. In your body, if there's a tear, blood can go where it shouldn't, which might make you feel dizzy or give you a headache. It sounds worrying, but doctors know how to take care of it and will tell you if they need to do anything to help.",I77.74,I77.74,True,True,88.26,1.0,1.0,3.260000000000005,1.6469483568075118,0.9479999999999991
Arteriovenous Malformation,Q28.2,"An Arteriovenous Malformation, or AVM, is a tangle of blood vessels in the brain. It's like when two roads that are not supposed to cross suddenly do. Blood can flow too quickly in these places, which isn't normal. Some people have an AVM and feel fine, without any symptoms. Doctors might find it by accident when looking for other things. It's good to know about AVMs, so you understand how they might affect the brain or health down the line.",Q28.2,Q28.2,True,True,83.36,1.0,1.0,1.6400000000000006,1.6757575757575758,1.9280000000000002
Carotid Body Tumor,D44.7,"A carotid body tumor is a lump that grows where a big blood vessel splits into two branches in your neck. This blood vessel is a main pathway for blood to your brain. The tumor is usually not cancer, so it doesn't spread to other parts of the body. Think of the carotid artery like a highway, and the tumor as a bump on the road. The bump is there, but it may not cause trouble right now. It's important to check on it from time to time to make sure it doesn't grow or cause problems.",D44.7,D18.01,False,True,88.87,0.0,1.0,3.8700000000000045,0.8410677618069815,0.025999999999999135
Carotid Artery Aneurysm,I72.0,"A carotid artery aneurysm is when a part of the carotid artery in your neck swells up like a bubble. This artery is one of the main blood tubes that brings blood from your heart to your brain. Sometimes, the wall of this tube gets weak and balloons out. If this bubble gets too big, it can cause problems. Think of it like a balloon; if it gets too big, it can pop. If this happens to the artery, it can make it hard for blood to reach your brain. Usually, this doesn’t cause problems right away, but doctors like to keep an eye on it to make sure it stays safe.",I72.0,I72.0,True,True,97.54,1.0,1.0,12.540000000000006,1.6147710487444609,-0.9080000000000013
Vertebral Artery Stenosis,I65.8,"Vertebral Artery Stenosis means that a blood vessel in your neck is narrower than it should be. This blood vessel, called the vertebral artery, sends blood to your brain. Imagine it is like a straw. If the straw gets squeezed, less liquid can pass through it. When less blood flows through the narrowed artery, it might not always cause problems, but it’s important for the brain to have enough blood. Knowing about this narrow artery can help you understand your body better and how to care for it.",I65.8,I65.0,False,True,90.39,0.0,1.0,5.390000000000001,0.8312989045383412,-0.278
