Atelectasis,J98.11,"Atelectasis happens when a part of your lung doesn't fully fill up with air. Think of your lung like a balloon. If the balloon isn’t filled with enough air, it can’t float. Similarly, when part of your lung doesn’t fill with enough air, it collapses a bit. This doesn’t mean it has a hole or is broken, just that it’s not fully expanded. This can happen after surgery or if you lie down for a long time. It usually doesn't cause big problems, but doctors like to know about it to watch your lung health.",J98.11,J98.11,True,True,83.05,1.0,1.0,1.9500000000000028,1.6677966101694914,1.9900000000000007
Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation,Q25.72,"A pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, or PAVM, is when the blood in your lungs takes a shortcut. Usually, blood goes through small paths in your lungs to get clean and pick up oxygen. Imagine you’re in a line, but sometimes, you skip to the front. That’s what happens here. Many people don’t feel any different. But sometimes, you might get tired or have trouble breathing. Your body might not get enough clean blood. Doctors sometimes check to see if the shortcut is growing to help you stay healthy.

Pneumonia,J18.9,"Pneumonia is an illness that affects the lungs. Think of your lungs like balloons. When you breathe in, these balloons fill up with air to help you get the oxygen your body needs. Pneumonia happens when the air sacs in the lungs become filled with fluid or pus, making it hard for the lungs to do their job. This might make you cough or feel short of breath. You could also have a fever or feel really tired.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),J44.9,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD, is when your lungs don't work as well as they should. With COPD, it's harder to breathe because the tubes that move air in and out of your lungs are partly blocked. Think of trying to drink a milkshake through a straw that is pinched.
