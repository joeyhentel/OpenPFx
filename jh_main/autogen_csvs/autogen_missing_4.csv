Mucosal Thickening in Sinuses,J32.9,"When the lining in the sinuses gets puffy, it's called mucosal thickening. Sinuses are small spaces in your head near your nose. This can happen if you have things like a cold or allergies. Think of how a stuffed-up nose feels during a cold. That's similar to how your sinuses might feel clogged. This is common and usually isn't serious. You might feel stuffy or have a runny nose. Usually, these symptoms go away in time. Sometimes, though, if your symptoms persist, it might be something that lasts longer, like chronic sinusitis, which needs a doctor's care.",J32.89,J32.9,True,False,77.43,1.0,0.0,7.569999999999993,0.8233372228704785,2.3139999999999987
Sinus Polyp,J33.8,"A sinus polyp is a soft, small bump that grows inside the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow spaces in your face bones near your nose. These polyps are not cancer; they won't hurt you. People often don't know they have them because they don't always cause problems. If they get big or if there are too many, they might block your nose and make it stuffy. Your nose might run more too. Imagine trying to breathe through a straw because of a balloon in the way; thatâ€™s how this might feel, especially with allergies.",J33.8,J33.0,False,True,91.71,0.0,1.0,6.709999999999994,0.825940337224384,-0.5419999999999987
Mucosal Thickening in Maxillary Sinus,J32.0,"Mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinus means the lining inside this air space in your cheek area is a bit thicker than usual. It's like when the walls of a soft bag get thicker. This often happens if you have a cold or allergies because your body makes more mucus to help you. Just like when your nose feels full or clogged, but this is in your face. It's usually not a big deal and tends to go away on its own after some time. Knowing this helps if you feel a little different in that area.",J32.0,J32.0,True,True,80.41,1.0,1.0,4.590000000000003,1.6357781753130591,2.5180000000000007
