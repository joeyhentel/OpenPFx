Mandibular Fracture,S02.609A,"A mandibular fracture, also known as a broken jaw, means that one of the bones in your lower jaw has cracked or broken. The mandible is the large bone that forms the lower part of your face and holds your lower teeth in place. Just like when a stick breaks, a strong force is usually needed to cause this fracture. This can happen from accidents like falling or being hit. Because the jaw is important for chewing and speaking, it can cause pain and make it difficult to eat or talk. The good news is that doctors can help fix it.",S02.6XXA,S02.6,False,False,88.26,0.0,0.0,3.260000000000005,0.046948356807511686,-0.652000000000001
Odontogenic Cyst,K09.0,"An odontogenic cyst is like a small bubble that can grow in your jaw. It is soft and filled with fluid, but it doesn't usually cause any pain. This type of cyst starts because of changes with a tooth, and the dentist wants to keep an eye on it. While the word 'cyst' might sound worrying, they are often very harmless. However, we keep watching them to make sure they don't grow too big. Your dentist will help make sure it stays small, like checking on a balloon to make sure it does not expand too much.",K09.0,K09.0,True,True,88.87,1.0,1.0,3.8700000000000045,1.6410677618069816,0.8259999999999992
Ameloblastoma,D16.5,"Ameloblastoma is a tiny bump in your jaw, like a small pebble hidden there. It's not dangerous right away and doesn't usually hurt. It starts where your teeth grow from in the jaw. Imagine it like a pearl that forms slowly. It is not a pearl, but just like how things can develop over time without you noticing, this bump can grow. It’s important to keep an eye on it so it doesn’t get bigger. Even though it was a surprise to find, it can be managed with doctor’s help.",D16.5,D16.5,True,True,92.22,1.0,1.0,7.219999999999999,1.624330900243309,0.15600000000000014
Deviated Nasal Septum,J34.2,"Inside your nose, there is a thin wall called a septum. This wall separates your right and left nostrils. Sometimes, the septum is not straight and is off to one side. This is called a deviated septum. It's like a bent stick that makes one side of your nose tighter than the other. Many people with a deviated septum have no problems. But some might have trouble breathing or get nosebleeds. It can also lead to sinus infections. If these issues happen, it is good to tell an adult.",J34.2,J34.2,True,True,86.81,1.0,1.0,1.8100000000000023,1.6711743772241994,1.2379999999999995
Nasal Cavity Mass,R22.0,"A nasal cavity mass means there is a lump or bump inside your nose. Think of it like a little hill where your nose should be flat and open. This bump can be made of different types of cells. Sometimes, the mass doesn't cause any trouble, but other times, it might block your nose and make it hard to breathe. Doctors need to do more tests to find out what kind of mass it is. Knowing about the mass helps in making sure you get the right care for it.",J34.89,J34.89,False,False,98.55,0.0,0.0,13.549999999999997,0.013745704467353957,-2.7099999999999995
Turbinate Hypertrophy,J34.3,"Turbinate hypertrophy is when the small bones inside your nose, called turbinates, grow too big. These bones help you breathe by cleaning and warming the air. But if they get too big, you might feel like your nose is clogged or stuffy. Imagine them like little speed bumps in your nose. If they are too high, it's hard for the air to pass through. It can be like when toys are scattered on the floor and you can't walk easily.

Cervical Lymphadenopathy,R59.0,"Cervical lymphadenopathy means that the lymph nodes in your neck are swollen. Lymph nodes are like tiny bean-shaped guards that help fight off germs. Sometimes if you have a cold or infection, these nodes may get bigger because they're working hard to fight it. This is called swelling.

Branchial Cleft Cyst,Q18.0,"Think of a little balloon under the skin on the side of your neck. That's what a branchial cleft cyst is like.

Thyroglossal Duct Cyst,Q89.2,"A thyroglossal duct cyst is a small, round lump you might find in the middle of your neck. It forms because a passageway, called the thyroglossal duct, didn't disappear as it should have before you were born. This duct helps guide the thyroid gland to its proper place during the early stages of your development. Usually, a thyroglossal duct cyst isn't a problem unless it becomes swollen or infected. If you notice changes in the cyst or it starts to bother you, it might need special care from a healthcare provider.",Q89.2,Q89.2,True,True,69.92,1.0,1.0,15.079999999999998,1.6124378109452737,4.616
