Pelvic Floor Relaxation,N81.83,"Pelvic floor relaxation is when the muscles supporting the organs in the lower belly become weaker. These muscles work like a hammock, holding organs like the bladder in place. If the hammock becomes loose, the organs can't stay in place well. This might cause discomfort and other issues, making bathroom visits tricky or creating pressure in the lower stomach area. Fortunately, this is common, and there are exercises and treatments available to strengthen these muscles and improve the condition over time.",N81.83,N81.9,False,True,63.49,0.0,1.0,21.509999999999998,0.8088849400266549,5.101999999999999
Asymmetric Appearance of the Vallecula,R93.89,"The vallecula is a small spot in your throat. It helps when you swallow. Sometimes, it can look uneven or different on each side. Doctors say it is 'asymmetric.' This is like how one hand might be a little bigger than the other. Usually, this is not a problem. It doesn’t mean anything is wrong. But if you feel anything strange when you swallow, it can be important to tell a doctor. Changes like these can help doctors decide if they need to check more carefully.",R93.89,R68.89,False,True,87.11,0.0,1.0,2.1099999999999994,0.8643086816720258,0.3780000000000001
Perinueral (Tarlov) Cysts,G96.191,"Perineural (Tarlov) cysts are little pockets filled with fluid that form around nerves in your lower back. Think of them as tiny water balloons. Most people with these cysts don't have any symptoms—they just sit there quietly like puddles that aren't in the way. Sometimes, if they get big enough, they can press on nerves and cause back pain, but this is not common. If you do have symptoms, doctors can explain what is happening and find ways to help you feel better.

Inguinal hernia,K40.91,"An inguinal hernia is when there’s a weak spot in the muscles in your belly, near the groin, and some tissue like your intestines pushes through it. It can look and feel like a small bump or lump in the groin area. You might notice it more when you cough, bend, or pick up heavy things. It can be a bit uncomfortable but doesn’t always hurt. Sometimes, it can cause bigger health problems if not checked. So, it’s good to understand what’s happening and keep an eye on it. This helps in knowing when to get help.",K40.91,K40.90,False,True,91.21,0.0,1.0,6.209999999999994,0.827739251040222,-0.44199999999999884
