Mitral Valve Calcification,I34.0,"Mitral valve calcification happens when the valve between the heart's left atrium and ventricle, called the mitral valve, gets calcium build-up. It's like minerals clogging a pipe at home. This makes the valve stiff and hard to move. Older people usually get this, and it often doesn't cause any signs. So, you might not notice anything. But sometimes, it can make the heart work harder. This is why it's good to know about it even if you feel okay.",I34.0,I34.0,True,True,85.39,1.0,1.0,0.39000000000000057,1.743884892086331,1.522
Right Ventricular Hypertrophy,I42.2,"Right Ventricular Hypertrophy, or RVH, means the right side of your heart has gotten thicker. Think of it like a muscle getting bigger when it gets used a lot. The right side of your heart sends blood to your lungs to pick up oxygen. When your heart works harder than normal, it can grow bigger. Sometimes, having thick heart muscles might not be bad, but it's good to know why it happened. This can be because of lung issues or heart problems you're born with. Understanding RVH helps in keeping your heart in good shape.",I42.2,I51.7,False,True,83.05,0.0,1.0,1.9500000000000028,0.8677966101694915,1.1900000000000006
Aortic Dissection,I71.00,"An aortic dissection happens when the inside layer of your largest blood vessel tears. It’s like a crack in a straw. The aorta is the big tube carrying blood from your heart. With a tear, blood sneaks between its layers, causing a problem. This can make the aorta weak and unsafe. Imagine if your favorite straw had a crack and leaked. It would be hard to use, right? Doctors might help by slowing your blood flow or fixing the tear to keep things safe. Keeping the aorta strong is important so everything works well inside your body.",I71.00,I71.00,True,True,85.89,1.0,1.0,0.8900000000000006,1.705820105820106,1.422
Coronary Artery Calcification,I25.10,"Coronary artery calcification is when little bits of calcium, like tiny rocks, start to build up in the heart's blood vessels. These vessels are like pipes that should be open and flexible to let blood flow easily. When the build-up happens, the pipes become stiff and narrow, making it harder for blood to move around. But don't worry, this is something that happens as we grow older. You can help keep your heart in good shape by eating healthy meals and getting plenty of exercise. This helps your blood vessels stay open and strong.",I25.10,I25.84,False,True,80.92,0.0,1.0,4.079999999999998,0.8393700787401576,1.6159999999999997
Pericarditis,I30.9,"Think of your heart wearing a thin coat called the pericardium. Sometimes, this coat can get upset and swollen, like when you scrape your knee. This condition is called pericarditis. It can make your chest feel sharp pain, especially if you breathe in or move around a lot. Even though it might seem worrisome, it usually goes away on its own, similar to how a bruise fades away as days pass. Just like taking a good rest helps a scraped knee heal faster, doing the same can help calm down the pericarditis too.",I30.9,I30.9,True,True,89.58,1.0,1.0,4.579999999999998,1.6358422939068102,0.6840000000000004
Dilated Cardiomyopathy,I42.0,"Dilated cardiomyopathy is like when a balloon stretches and gets too big. Instead of being small and firm, the heart becomes larger and its walls thinner. The heart has four sections, called chambers, and they pump blood throughout the body. When the heart is stretched out, it can’t pump blood as well as it should. This can make someone feel tired and short of breath. It might even cause swelling in parts of the body like the legs and feet. Doctors can help manage it so the heart works better and feels better.",I42.0,I42.0,True,True,91.82,1.0,1.0,6.819999999999993,1.6255754475703326,0.23600000000000132
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,I42.1,"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy means that the heart walls get thick. Imagine blowing a balloon until it has thick walls. When the heart walls are too thick, blood can’t flow out well. Some people might feel chest pain or their heart beating fast. They might also feel tired. Many others might not feel anything at all.

Restrictive Cardiomyopathy,I42.5,"Restrictive Cardiomyopathy makes the heart stiff. It's like squeezing a balloon with sand inside. Normally, the heart is soft and can easily pump blood. But when it's stiff, it can't fill with blood well when it relaxes. This stiffness makes it hard to pump properly. A person might feel really tired. They might find it hard to breathe when running or walking fast. Having a stiff heart can sometimes make everyday activities more difficult. Just like a sand-filled balloon can't stretch well, the heart has a hard time stretching to fill with blood.",I42.5,I42.3,False,True,77.94,0.0,1.0,7.060000000000002,0.8248138957816378,2.2120000000000006
Aortic Valve Stenosis,I35.0,"Aortic valve stenosis means the valve in your heart narrows. Think of it like a door that barely opens, so blood can’t flow through easily. Your heart might have to push harder to get blood to your body. You might feel really tired, dizzy, or have a chest pain. This might happen as you get older or because of health issues. Doctors can find out if you have it with heart tests. Sometimes, it can be treated with medicine or surgery if needed.

Mitral Valve Prolapse,I34.1,"Mitral valve prolapse, or MVP, means part of your heart's valve doesn't shut tightly. Imagine a door that doesn't close all the way. This valve helps blood move the right way. When it doesn't shut well, some blood might sneak backward. Most people don't feel any different and live normal lives. Sometimes, doctors listen for a ""click"" or a whooshing sound when the blood moves. It's not something to worry about right now, but it's a good idea for a doctor to check it from time to time.",I34.1,I34.1,True,True,92.53,1.0,1.0,7.530000000000001,1.6234466588511138,0.09399999999999986
Cardiac Tumor,D15.1,"A cardiac tumor is a growth in your heart. Imagine your heart as a pump that sends blood throughout your body. Sometimes, a lump can form inside it. These lumps are called tumors. Not all tumors are harmful. Some are benign, meaning they don’t spread to other parts of your body. Others can be malignant or cancerous and might cause bigger problems. It’s important to know what kind of tumor it is so doctors can decide the best way to help.

Pulmonary Nodule,R91.1,"A pulmonary nodule is a small and round spot that shows up on a lung X-ray or CT scan. Imagine it as a tiny dot on a piece of paper. Most nodules are not dangerous and can come from old infections, scars, or small non-cancerous lumps. They are usually tiny, like a pea. Doctors sometimes check them over time to see if they change. This doesn't mean there's trouble, just that they want to be sure. It sounds scarier than it is, but often these nodules do not cause problems.",R91.1,R91.1,True,True,92.22,1.0,1.0,7.219999999999999,1.624330900243309,0.15600000000000014
Lung Mass,R91.8,"A lung mass means there is a spot in your lungs that looks different from the rest. Think about having a group of red apples, but one apple is green. That's how this spot stands out. Most of the time, these spots aren't dangerous, but doctors might want to check them out more. They might do extra tests to see if this spot needs special attention.

Lung Cyst,J98.4,A lung cyst is like a small bubble filled with air or fluid that appears in the lung. Think of it as a tiny balloon inside your lung. Your lungs are also like balloons that help you breathe. A lung cyst usually does not cause symptoms or problems. Most people do not even notice it. Doctors may find lung cysts by accident when looking for something else. These cysts often do not need treatment.

Pulmonary Fibrosis,J84.10,"Pulmonary fibrosis is when lung tissue gets damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it harder for your lungs to work properly. As the lung tissue becomes more scarred, you might find it more difficult to breathe deeply. Imagine if a sponge gets hardened and doesn’t soak water – similarly, lungs with fibrosis don’t take in air as easily as they should.
