Peritoneal Cyst,K66.8,"Imagine you have a tiny water balloon inside your tummy. This balloon is called a peritoneal cyst. It sits quietly in a soft covering around your stomach and other parts, like your intestines. These cysts are usually no big deal. You probably won’t even notice them, and they do not hurt. Sometimes doctors find them when they look at your belly for other reasons. Usually, you don’t have to do anything about them. They just stay there, like a small, still balloon, not causing any trouble. So, there's no need to be concerned.",K66.8,K66.8,True,True,86.4,1.0,1.0,1.4000000000000057,1.6833333333333331,1.319999999999999
