Enlarged Virchow-Robin Spaces,G93.9,"The MRI showed something called 'enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces.' This might sound hard, but it’s not. In your brain, there are little spaces filled with fluid, like tiny rivers. Sometimes, these spaces get a bit bigger. It's like when a river swells after rain. Usually, this is normal and doesn’t cause any trouble. Think of it as a little part of how your brain is made, just like everyone has different features.

Microangiopathy,I67.89,"Microangiopathy happens when tiny blood vessels in the body don't work as they should. Think of these tiny vessels as little roads that blood uses to travel. If these roads become bumpy or blocked, it can make it hard for blood to get where it needs to go, like your brain. This might sometimes cause dizziness or headaches, but not always. Doctors pay attention to this because it helps them understand your health better. Microangiopathy is often seen with other health issues like diabetes or high blood pressure, which affect these small roads too.",I67.89,I67.89,True,True,80.92,1.0,1.0,4.079999999999998,1.6393700787401575,2.416
Pineal Cyst,D35.4,"A pineal cyst is a small sac filled with fluid in your brain. It is found in the pineal gland, a tiny part of your brain. Imagine it like a little water balloon inside your head. Most people don't know they have a pineal cyst because it usually doesn't cause any problems. These cysts are often found by accident during brain scans for other reasons. It's like having a tiny freckle. It doesn't really bother you or cause any harm.

Porencephalic Cyst,Q04.6,"Think of your brain like a loaf of bread. Sometimes there are little air bubbles inside the bread. A porencephalic cyst is like one of those bubbles, but in your brain, and it's filled with fluid. This fluid is the same type that helps cushion your brain and spine.

Subependymal Nodules,Q04.8,"Subependymal nodules are small bumps that can form in the brain. Think of them like very tiny pebbles in a pond. These nodules can appear due to certain conditions that affect the body, like neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis. While the thought of having something in the brain might be a little frightening, these nodules usually don’t cause trouble.

Perivascular Spaces Dilatation,G93.9,"Perivascular spaces are like tiny tubes around the blood vessels in the brain where fluid flows. They help keep the brain clean and working well by washing away waste. Sometimes, these spaces can get bigger, just like a pipe that becomes wider. This is called dilatation. Usually, this doesn't cause any problems and is often just something seen when looking at a brain scan. It can be connected to getting older.

White Matter Disease,R90.82 ,"White matter disease is a condition that affects the brain. The brain is like a giant network of highways that helps with thinking and balance. White matter is like the roads that connect important places. Over time, these roads can wear down. This can happen more often as people get older.

Gliosis,R90.89,"Gliosis is when the brain tries to fix itself after being hurt, a bit like when you get a cut and your skin heals with a scar. When the brain is damaged by an injury, disease, or illness, tiny helper cells called glial cells get to work. These glial cells are good because they try to protect and repair the brain. However, as they do this, they can sometimes leave behind a mark called gliosis. This mark tells doctors that something happened to that part of the brain in the past.

Cerebral Atrophy,G31.1,"Cerebral atrophy means the brain shrinks. Think of it like a balloon losing air; over time the brain gets smaller. This often happens as we get older, but can sometimes be due to illnesses. When the brain shrinks, it can change how it works. Some people might find remembering things or talking slightly harder than before. Not everyone with this condition will notice changes, but it’s important to watch out for any differences.

Colloid Cyst,G93.0,"A colloid cyst is like a small, jelly-like bubble in the brain. It usually forms in a special spot called the third ventricle. This area helps brain fluid, like water, move around your brain and spine. If the cyst gets too big, it can block this fluid, like a leaf blocking water in a pipe.

Diffuse Axonal Injury,S06.2X0A,"A diffuse axonal injury happens when the brain experiences a strong shake or turn, like if you spin around too fast and get dizzy. This shaking can stretch the tiny parts inside the brain, called axons, which usually carry messages. When they stretch too much, they can't send messages correctly. This can change how someone thinks, feels, or moves. Even if the person doesn't pass out, it's still a problem.
