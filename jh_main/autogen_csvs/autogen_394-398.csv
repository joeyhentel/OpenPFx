Prostatic Hyperplasia ,N40.0,"Prostatic Hyperplasia is a medical term that you may hear from your doctor. It means that the prostate gland, which is a small organ in men just below the bladder, has grown bigger than usual. This is common among men as they get older. Imagine the prostate as a small balloon that slowly gets bigger. Sometimes, when it gets bigger, it can make it harder for urine to pass through, like a river trying to flow through a narrow path. This can cause some men to need to use the bathroom more often, or have trouble starting or stopping when they do. Even though it might sound scary, it's not cancer and can often be managed with medicine or other treatments.",N40.1,N40.1,False,False,79.3,0.0,0.0,5.700000000000003,0.029850746268656705,1.1400000000000006
Pelvic Lymphadenopathy,R59.0,"Pelvic lymphadenopathy means that the nodes in your pelvis, found between the hips, are larger than normal. Lymph nodes are tiny, bean-shaped things that help the body fight sickness. They can get bigger for many reasons, like when you're sick or when there's swelling. Sometimes they grow because of other reasons. Think of it like a security team getting bigger to help protect the area better. If lymph nodes are swollen, it means the body might be trying to handle something odd, so it can be important to understand what's going on.",R59.0,R59.1,False,True,81.33,0.0,1.0,3.6700000000000017,0.8428265524625268,1.5340000000000005
Hemorrhagic Cyst,N83.29,"A hemorrhagic cyst is a small, pouch-like structure in the body that fills with blood and fluid. They often form in the ovaries. You can think of it like a tiny bag that holds liquid. Sometimes, they can leak some blood. Most of the time, these cysts go away on their own and don't cause problems. If it becomes bigger or hurts, it's good to have a doctor take a look to make sure everything is okay. It's like a small cloud that disappears without turning into a storm.",N83.29,N83.20,False,True,92.42,0.0,1.0,7.420000000000002,0.8237529691211402,-0.6840000000000004
Para-ovarian Cyst,N83.20,"A para-ovarian cyst is like a small water balloon next to an ovary. It forms outside the ovary, not inside. These cysts are common and usually do not harm you. Most people don’t even know they have one because they do not hurt or cause problems. Doctors often find them when looking for something else. Usually, you don’t need to do anything about them. They rarely grow big enough to cause discomfort. If you have one, it is nice to know it is there, but you usually don’t need to worry much about it.",N83.20,N83.8,False,True,84.88,0.0,1.0,0.12000000000000455,0.9785714285714279,0.824000000000001
