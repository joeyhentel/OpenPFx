This can cause problems because food or liquid can go into your lungs instead of your stomach, which might make you cough or have trouble breathing. It is important to be careful when eating or drinking and to watch for any signs of coughing or breathing difficulties.

Carotid Artery Stenosis,I65.2,"Carotid artery stenosis means that one of the main blood vessels in your neck, called the carotid artery, is narrower than it should be. This can happen because of a buildup of fatty deposits, known as plaque, inside the artery walls. When the artery is too narrow, it can slow down or block the blood flow to your brain. This is important because your brain needs a steady supply of blood to work properly.

Arteriovenous Malformation,Q28.2,"An arteriovenous malformation, or AVM, is like a tangle of blood vessels in your body. Normally, blood flows from arteries to veins through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. But in an AVM, the blood skips the capillaries and goes straight from arteries to veins. This can cause problems because the blood vessels in an AVM are not as strong as normal ones. They might break and bleed, which can be dangerous. AVMs can happen anywhere in the body, but they are most serious when they are in the brain.
