Adrenal Adenoma,D35.00,"An adrenal adenoma is a small, harmless bump on the adrenal gland. These glands sit on top of each kidney and help your body work right by making hormones. Hormones are like messengers for energy and keeping your heart steady. Usually, these bumps don't cause problems and are found by accident during other tests. It's like seeing an extra puzzle piece that doesn't change the picture. We keep an eye on these bumps to make sure they don't change. Remember, they are not something to worry about but just something to watch.",D35.00
Adrenal Hematoma,E27.8,"An adrenal hematoma is a bit like a small bruise on your adrenal gland. These glands sit on top of your kidneys and make hormones. When they have a little bleed inside, it’s called a hematoma. Imagine when you fall and get a bruise; this is similar, but it happens inside your body. Normally, your body can fix this on its own, and the hematoma fades just like a bruise does. But sometimes a doctor will want to keep an eye on it, to make sure everything is okay later.",E27.8
Adrenal Hyperplasia,E27.0,"Adrenal hyperplasia means the adrenal glands, tiny organs on top of your kidneys, are larger than normal. These glands make important hormones. Sometimes, they can make too much of these hormones, like a machine that makes too many toys. This extra hormone can affect how your body works in different ways, like how you grow or how you handle stress. It’s like having more than what is needed. Knowing about this can help you understand more about your health and what is happening in your body.",E27.0
Adrenal Mass,R93.8,"An adrenal mass is a growth on one of the adrenal glands. These glands are small and sit on top of each kidney. They help the body make hormones that are important for stress and blood pressure. Sometimes, doctors find these masses by accident when doing scans for other reasons. Having an adrenal mass doesn’t always mean there’s a problem. It’s important for a doctor to check it out to know more. They might do more tests to learn if it’s something to worry about or not. Each step helps the doctor understand what’s happening better.",R93.8
Adrenal Cortical Adenoma,D35.00,"An adrenal cortical adenoma is a small, harmless bump in the adrenal gland. The adrenal glands sit on top of your kidneys.

Mostly, there's no need to worry about these tiny bumps.",D35.00
Adrenal Hyperfunction,E27.8,"Imagine having little adjusters in your body that help keep everything steady. These are your adrenal glands, sitting on top of your kidneys. They make hormones that handle your body's energy use, how you respond to stress, and even how your blood pressure stays in check. Now, think of a water faucet—when adrenal glands are working too much, it's like the faucet is turned too far, letting too much water out. This can make your body feel off-balance, just like too much water can overflow a cup. This might affect your mood, energy, and how your body works.",E27.8
Adrenal Gland Tumor,D44.7,"An adrenal gland tumor is like finding a small, unexpected bump in a place we didn’t think to look. These bumps, or tumors, appear on the adrenal glands, which sit like little caps on top of each kidney. These glands are small but mighty, as they produce hormones that help our body manage things like blood pressure and reactions to stress. Some tumors don’t cause harm, similar to certain moles on our skin, but others might need special attention as they could change how the body works. It’s essential to learn about these surprises in our body as it helps us stay informed and make decisions about what, if anything, should happen next.",D44.7
Adrenal Cyst,E27.8,"An adrenal cyst is like a small balloon filled with water that grows in a gland above your kidneys.

Often, these cysts are found by accident when you're having pictures taken of your belly. Usually, they don't cause problems and won't need any special treatment. It's just something doctors like to keep an eye on, similar to watching a pot of water on the stove to make sure it doesn't overflow.

Neurogenic Bladder,N31.9,"A neurogenic bladder is when your bladder doesn't listen to signals from the brain well because the nerves are not working right.
