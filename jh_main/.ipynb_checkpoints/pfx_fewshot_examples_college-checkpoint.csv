Head,Cerebral cavernous malformation,I67.1,"A small cavernous malformation of the brain is a collection of abnormal blood vessels that is typically benign and often discovered incidentally when imaging is done. Patients should understand that these small malformations usually do not cause symptoms and usually do not require treatment. However, it's important to have periodic follow-ups with a neurologist to monitor for any changes, as there is a slight risk of bleeding which could lead to symptoms like headaches or seizures. If symptoms develop or if there are concerns about the malformation's behavior, the neurologist may discuss management options, which could range from observation to, in rare cases, surgical intervention.",I67.1
Head,Infundibulum of cerebral artery,Q28.2,"An infundibulum detected on an MRI of the brain is a benign and typically incidental finding characterized by a funnel-shaped dilation at the origin of a cerebral artery. Patients should be reassured that an infundibulum is usually asymptomatic and does not pose any significant health risk, often requiring no further treatment or intervention.",Q28.2
Neck,Tornwaldt cyst,J39.2,"A Tornwaldt cyst, often detected incidentally on an MRI of the neck, is a benign and typically asymptomatic cyst located in the nasopharynx. Patients should know that these cysts usually do not require treatment unless they cause symptoms like nasal obstruction or recurrent infections. In such cases, a consultation with an ENT specialist is recommended to discuss potential treatment options, which may include drainage or surgical removal.",J39.2
Head,Fluid in the right petrous apex,H70.8,"A small amount of incidentally found fluid in the petrous apex detected on an MRI of the brain is generally a benign finding and usually does not cause any symptoms. Patients should be reassured that this type of fluid accumulation is typically harmless and does not usually require treatment. If symptoms such as headaches, hearing loss, or dizziness develop, further evaluation may be needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.",H70.8
Abdomen,Spinal hemangioma,D18.09,"A spinal hemangioma, often found incidentally on an MRI of the abdomen, is a benign vascular tumor located within the vertebrae. Patients should understand that these lesions are typically asymptomatic and usually do not require treatment unless they cause pain, neurological symptoms, or structural instability. If symptoms arise, consultation with a spine specialist is advisable to discuss management options, which may include observation, pain management, or in rare cases, surgical intervention.",D18.09
