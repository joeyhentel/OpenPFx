Cyst of Oral Mucosa,K09.8,"A cyst of the oral mucosa is a tiny, harmless bubble in your mouth. It is usually filled with clear fluid and is quite small. These bubbles happen when a small saliva gland gets blocked. This causes saliva to get trapped. Usually, these cysts don't hurt, and you may not even feel them. They often go away by themselves. To keep your mouth healthy, brush your teeth well and drink lots of water. Remember, these cysts are not usually a reason to worry.",K09.8,K11.6,False,True,86.3,0.0,1.0,1.2999999999999972,0.8869565217391306,0.5400000000000006
Leukoplakia of Tongue,K13.21,"Leukoplakia is like when your tongue decides to wear a white patch that doesn’t wipe off easily. Think of it as a mysterious spot on the surface of your tongue. These are white or gray patches formed by cells on your tongue's surface. They can appear for many reasons, like smoking or chewing tobacco, or sometimes even from an old habit of biting your cheek. While leukoplakia may seem strange, it doesn’t usually cause pain and often isn’t serious, but it’s like your tongue is waving a small flag, so keeping an eye on it is a good idea.",K13.21,K13.21,True,True,76.76,1.0,1.0,8.239999999999995,1.6216450216450218,3.2479999999999993
Mucocele of Oral Mucosa,K11.6,"Think of a mucocele as a tiny bubble inside your mouth. It's not dangerous. It happens when something blocks a small gland that makes spit, like a clogged pipe. This makes a bump filled with liquid, like a little balloon. You might find one on the inside of your lips or the floor of your mouth. They don’t usually hurt, but you might notice them when you move your tongue or look in the mirror. Most of the time, these bumps disappear on their own, like when a bubble pops and goes away.",K11.6,K11.6,True,True,91.82,1.0,1.0,6.819999999999993,1.6255754475703326,0.23600000000000132
Orbital Mass,H05.89,"An orbital mass is a lump near the eye, in a section called the orbit. If you think of your eye area as a small field, this lump is like a little hill that popped up. 

We do not always know why orbital masses appear. Sometimes, they are harmless and do not cause any problems. Other times they might need attention because the orbit holds important things—like the eye, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. 

Doctors might suggest tests to learn more about the mass to understand its effect on these important parts and ensure everything is okay.",H05.89,H05.89,True,True,80.41,1.0,1.0,4.590000000000003,1.6357781753130591,2.5180000000000007
Proptosis,H05.22,"Proptosis is when your eyes look like they are sticking out more than normal. This can happen because something behind the eyes is pushing them forward, like swelling or a mass. Sometimes, the cause can be linked to conditions like Graves' disease, which affects the thyroid. Imagine your eyes are like a button being pushed from behind. It is important to find out why this is happening, as it could be related to the muscles or other parts near your eyes. Doctors may need to explore the cause further to help manage the condition.",H05.22,H05.20,False,True,72.46,0.0,1.0,12.540000000000006,0.8147710487444609,3.3080000000000016
Optic Nerve Glioma,D33.3,"An optic nerve glioma is a slow-growing tumor found on the optic nerve, which connects the eyes to the brain. This growth is not typically fast, and it doesn't usually cause problems immediately. Sometimes, it can make vision blurry, similar to looking through dirty glasses. Doctors monitor these tumors regularly to ensure they don't change or cause issues. Think of it as checking on a garden to ensure it grows properly. By visiting the doctor, we make sure everything is going well with your eyes.",D33.3,D33.3,True,True,65.52,1.0,1.0,19.480000000000004,1.609765625,5.496
