It affects the adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, which are responsible for producing important hormones. In this condition, the glands produce too much of a hormone called androgen and not enough of others. This can lead to changes in how the body grows and develops. It’s a bit like a recipe missing key ingredients—without them, the dish doesn't turn out as expected. Although it's not usually harmful, it requires management to ensure healthy growth.\",\n",
