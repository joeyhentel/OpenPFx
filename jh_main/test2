Adrenal Hematoma,E27.8,"An adrenal hematoma is like a bruise that forms on your adrenal gland. Your adrenal glands are small, important organs that sit on top of your kidneys. They help make hormones that control things like your energy and stress levels. Sometimes, blood vessels can break and cause blood to pool, creating a hematoma, which is similar to getting a bruise. You might not even know it's there because it often doesn't cause symptoms. Doctors usually find it by chance. Most adrenal hematomas don't cause harm and can heal by themselves over time.",E27.8,PFx_ICD10_code,False,True,83.56,0.0,1.0,1.4399999999999977,0.8819672131147542,1.0879999999999996
