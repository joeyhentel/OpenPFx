Carotid Artery Stenosis,I65.2,"Carotid artery stenosis means that one of the main blood vessels in your neck, called the carotid artery, is narrower than it should be. This can happen because of a buildup of fatty deposits, which are like sticky patches inside the artery. When the artery is narrow, it can make it harder for blood to flow to your brain.
