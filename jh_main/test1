Adrenal Adenoma,D35.00,"An adrenal adenoma is like a small, non-cancerous bump that grows on the adrenal glands, which are located above your kidneys. These glands produce hormones that help control many important functions in your body, like blood pressure, metabolism, and the production of stress hormones. Most of the time, adrenal adenomas don't cause any problems and don't need treatment. They usually don't make extra hormones or cause any symptoms. An adrenal adenoma is usually discovered by chance during an imaging test done for another reason. Just like finding an old bookmark in a book you've already read, it's there but not causing any harm. It's good to know about it, but often there's nothing to worry about.",D35.00,D35.00,True,True,71.55,1.0,1.0,13.450000000000003,1.613840830449827,4.290000000000001
