# OpenPFx
## Making medical reports understandable.
OpenPFx is an open-source program that uses generative AI to generate patient-friendly explanations (PFx) of medical findings. 

**[Visit Website](https://openpfx.streamlit.app)**

## Key Features 

### üìä Advanced Stats:

**ICD-10 Codes**: standard medical codes used worldwide to label diseases and health conditions

> DISCLAIMER: ICD-10 codes provided by this tool are approximations for informational use and may be inaccurate. Always confirm final codes with a licensed clinician or certified medical coder.


**Readability**: The Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) is used to measure

**Accuracy**: measured through mutliple ICD-10 checks
> When the LLM generates a PFx, it also assigns an ICD-10 code to its own response. A separate agent then reads that PFx and assigns a code as well. The first three digits of both predictions are compared to the first three digits of the true ICD-10 code. Each correct match earns a point, and the two points are averaged.

### üìù Pre-Generated PFx: 

On website, navigate to Browse PFx page. Select desired workflow (see workflow explanations below) and finding(s).

### üñ•Ô∏è Generate Your Own PFx:

On website, navigate to Generate page. Input finding, model, desired grade level, workflow (see explanation below), and ICD-10 Code (optional)
>ICD-10 code will be autofilled if you don't input one
>FRES + Accuracy metrics provided


## Workflows Explained
OpenPFx offers four approaches for generating explanations

[See All Prompts Here](./Generated_PFx_CSVs/)

### Zero-shot Prompting 
No context such as a template or an example letter is provided, requiring the LLM to rely solely on its previous knowledge. 

### Few-shot Prompting
Provides context such as sample responses or templates.

### Agentic 
Structured process that enables AI models, acting as "agents," to iteratively refine their outputs based on feedback and contextual adjustments.

OpenPFx uses the AG2 (formally Autogen) framework. Below is a flowchart of the original workflow used.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run **OpenPFx** locally.

### Prerequisites

### Installation

#### üêß Linux / üçè macOS

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/OpenPFx.git
cd OpenPFx
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set environment variables**  
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
